# Project FREElance - MS3

# Pre-development

## Functional specifications - Given by Code Institute
- LO1	Design, develop and implement a back-end for a web application using Python and a micro-framework
- LO2	Demonstrate competence in modeling and managing non-relational data
- LO3	Demonstrate competence in querying and manipulating non-relational data
- LO4	Deploy a full stack web application to a Cloud platform
- LO5	Identify and apply security features

### What this means
- Build a web application that is powering a non-relational database.
- Ensure UX design is considered throughout, producing a site that is functional and easily navigable
- Create a website using the principles of MVCs using Python as a back end language.
- Deploy correctly and without error to the Heroku platform
- Ensure that secret keys are hidden within the GitHub platform, so that the site is less vulnerable to attack.
- Ensure the website is standard in terms of style.
- Ensure that there is accessibility even for those people who use assistive technology
- Make sure the website responds to different devices.  No point in a website that breaks when viewed on mobile.
- Static website produced using HTML (passing quality check)
- Styled using CSS and bootstrap (passing quality check)
- JavaScript not required, but can be implemented. For example, bootstrap will use JQuery.
- No Lorem ipsum text.
- Ensure this is fully documented and commented to be clear to any developer reading through.

## User stories

### First Time Users

- As a first time user (developer), I want to be able to sign up quickly and easily, creating an account that can be seen by agencies.
- As a first time user (developer), I want to be able to search through companies that closely match my profile and see if they have jobs available.
- As a first time user (company), I want to be able to search through the available developers based on several different criteria.
- As a first time user (company/developer), I want assurances that my personal email will not be spammed by unscrupulous users.
- As a first time user sending a message, I want the system to be simple and similar to email, that I am familiar with.

### Hitting these targets

### Returning User
- As a user, I want to be able to check on the progress of my applications sent or received.
- As a user, I want to be able to contact the site admin if there is a problem, or to report suspicious activity.
- As a user, I want to be able to follow up any messages that have been sent to me.
- (extension: As a user, I may want to create coding groups so that I can share hints and tips with my fellow coders)
- (extension: As a user, I may want to view coding groups so that I can wee who is active and may be worth approaching with a job)

### Hitting these targets


**Edit a file, create a new file, and clone from Bitbucket in under 2 minutes**

When you're done, you can delete the content in this README and update the file with details for others getting started with your repository.

*We recommend that you open this README in another tab as you perform the tasks below. You can [watch our video](https://youtu.be/0ocf7u76WSo) for a full demo of all the steps in this tutorial. Open the video in a new tab to avoid leaving Bitbucket.*

## Edit a file

You’ll start by editing this README file to learn how to edit a file in Bitbucket.

1. Click **Source** on the left side.
2. Click the README.md link from the list of files.
3. Click the **Edit** button.
4. Delete the following text: *Delete this line to make a change to the README from Bitbucket.*
5. After making your change, click **Commit** and then **Commit** again in the dialog. The commit page will open and you’ll see the change you just made.
6. Go back to the **Source** page.

## Create a file

Next, you’ll add a new file to this repository.

1. Click the **New file** button at the top of the **Source** page.
2. Give the file a filename of **contributors.txt**.
3. Enter your name in the empty file space.
4. Click **Commit** and then **Commit** again in the dialog.
5. Go back to the **Source** page.

Before you move on, go ahead and explore the repository. You've already seen the **Source** page, but check out the **Commits**, **Branches**, and **Settings** pages.

## Clone a repository

Use these steps to clone from SourceTree, our client for using the repository command-line free. Cloning allows you to work on your files locally. If you don't yet have SourceTree, [download and install first](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/). If you prefer to clone from the command line, see [Clone a repository](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/4whODQ).

1. You’ll see the clone button under the **Source** heading. Click that button.
2. Now click **Check out in SourceTree**. You may need to create a SourceTree account or log in.
3. When you see the **Clone New** dialog in SourceTree, update the destination path and name if you’d like to and then click **Clone**.
4. Open the directory you just created to see your repository’s files.

Now that you're more familiar with your Bitbucket repository, go ahead and add a new file locally. You can [push your change back to Bitbucket with SourceTree](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/iqyBMg), or you can [add, commit,](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/8QhODQ) and [push from the command line](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/NQ0zDQ).
